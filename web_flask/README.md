# web_flask

# Description:

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is designed to be lightweight, flexible, and easy to use, making it a popular choice for building web applications. Flask provides a simple way to define routes and handle HTTP requests and responses, as well as a built-in templating engine for generating dynamic HTML content.

One of the main advantages of Flask is its modular design. Flask does not come with a lot of built-in functionality, but instead allows you to add extensions and plugins as needed. This makes it easy to tailor the framework to your specific needs and to only include the features you actually need.
